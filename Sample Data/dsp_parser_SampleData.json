Group Policy Objects (GPOs) linked at the domain NC head can affect all systems, including domain controllers, in a given domain. Changes in the delegation to this special object could grant unprivileged users the ability to synchronize the Active Directory database for offline cracking (i.e. DCSync attack). This indicator shows any delegation changes that have occurred on the domain NC head in the last week.
