name: Rare/New Outbound connections from VMs by process and location
description: |
  This identifies if there is unusual connections to an unexpected remote location from a VM
  when compared with the last 30 days.
  This may indicate connection to a C2 or data exfiltration from the associated VM.
  It is recommended that you understand what the associated process is and whether or not this is expected.
