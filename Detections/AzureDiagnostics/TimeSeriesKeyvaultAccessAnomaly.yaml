name: Key vault access TimeSeries anomaly
description: |
  This query will identify anamalous keyvault access. 
  The query leverages KQL built-in anomaly detection algorithm find large deviations from baseline keyvault access pattern. 
  Any sudden increase in count of keyvault access can be an indication of adversary dumping credential via automated ways.
