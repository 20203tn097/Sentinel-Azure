  'Looking for GetCallerIdentity Events where the UserID Type is AssumedRole 
  An attacker who has assumed the role of a legitimate account can call the GetCallerIdentity function to determine what account they are using.
  A legitimate user using legitimate credentials would not need to call GetCallerIdentity since they should already know what account they are using.
