name: Time Series Anomaly detection for Total volume in network logs- MultiVendor
description: |
  This query will identify anamalous spike in network traffic logs as compared to baseline or normal historical pattern. 
  The query leverages KQL built-in anomaly detection algorithm find large deviations from baseline pattern. 
  Any sudden increase in network traffic volume may be an indication of data exfiltration attempts and should be investigated.
  Adjust score threshold value to find the far outlier than baseline. Higher the score, far it is from baseline value
