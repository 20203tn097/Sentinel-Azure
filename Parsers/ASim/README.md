# Deploy ASIM

This template deploys all [ASIM](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelNormalization) parsers.The Azure Sentinel Information Mode (ASIM) enables you to use and create source-agnostic content, simplifying your analysis of the data in your Azure Sentinel workspace.

Note: Please ensure that the subscription, resource group and location are the same as your current Azure Sentinel (Log Analytics) workspace to prevent duplicate workspaces from being created.
