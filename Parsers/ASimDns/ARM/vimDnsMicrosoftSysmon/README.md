# Microsoft Windows Events Sysmon ASIM Dns Normalization Parser

This template deploys the ASIM Dns schema parser for Microsoft Windows Events Sysmon.

Filter and normalize Sysmon for Windows DNS events (event number 22) collected using the Log Analytics agent to the ASIM DNS activity normalized schema. The parser supports events collected to both the Event and WindowsEvent tables.

The Advanced SIEM Information Model (ASIM) enables you to use and create source-agnostic content, simplifying your analysis of the data in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
