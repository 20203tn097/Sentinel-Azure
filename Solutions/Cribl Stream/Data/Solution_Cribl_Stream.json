  "Description": "- Review the solution [Release Notes](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Solutions/Cribl/ReleaseNotes.md)\r\n\r\nCribl is a leading observability platform that provides automatic and intelligent observability at scale for cloud-native and enterprise workloads; with Cribl Application Security, your DevSecOps teams can resolve security issues faster, accelerating software delivery.\r\nIntegrating Cribl with Microsoft Sentinel enables DevSecOps teams to detect, prioritize, triage, and remediate attacks rapidly. DevSecOps teams benefit from the high-accuracy threat signals Cribl surfaces. It helps them avoid time-consuming investigation activities, freeing them up for more critical tasks.\r\nMicrosoft Sentinel data connectors poll Cribl for new [attacks, vulnerabilities, audit logs](https://www.Cribl.com/platform/application-security/), and [problem events](https://docs.Cribl.com/docs/shortlink/davis-ai-landing).\r\n\r\n**Included data connectors:**\r\n- **Attacks**, Common attacks on application layer vulnerabilities which can be detected and blocked using Cribl, like SQL injection, command injection, and JNDI attacks.\r\n- **Runtime vulnerabilities**, Software vulnerabilities detected throughout all layers of the application stack.\r\n- **Audit logs**, Security-relevant events for a Cribl tenant.\r\n- **Problems**, AI-powered observability problems raised across cloud and hybrid environments.\r\n\r\n[Learn More about Cribl](https://www.Cribl.com/) | [Cribl Docs](https://docs.Cribl.com/docs)",
