Included with CustomTable, AMA, DCR, DCE ready to go and ingesting Cowrie events on host. You can deploy this as a internal / private sensor (HoneyPot) on your existing virtual netwrk and subnet acting as a tripwire and can use the detection rules. Alternatively you can deploy sensor (HoneyPot) publically on the Internet and collect threat inetellegnce. This connector provides Microsoft Sentinel the capability to view dashboards, create custom alerts, collect Threat Intellegence",
