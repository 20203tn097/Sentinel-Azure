# Recorded Future Identity Solution 

Recorded Future Identity Intelligence enables security and IT teams to detect identity compromises. 

Recorded Future automates the collection, analysis, and production of identity intelligence from a vast range of sources. 

You can incorporate identity intelligence into automated workflows that regularly monitor for compromised credentials and take immediate action using Recorded Future Identity data and Microsoft Entra ID.

There are many ways organizations can utilize Recorded Future Identity Intelligence. The Azure Logic Apps in this Solution provided as examples and are a quick introduction to some of those ways. 

These playbooks include several actions that can be coordinated, or used separately. 

They include:

1. Searches for compromised workforce or external customer users
1. Looking up existing users and saving the compromised user data to a Log file
1. Confirming high risk Microsoft Entra ID (EntraID) users
1. Adding a compromised user to an EntraID security group


These playbooks and actions are designed to meet the following use cases:

1. **My Organization ("Workforce" use case)** 

Organizations seeking to proactively protect their own employees from account takeovers and prevent outside third parties from using employee credentials to gain access to sensitive company information can use the Identity Intelligence module in two ways:
- on a periodic basis, query Recorded Future identity intelligence (via "Credential Search" Action) for any "new" employee credentials that may have been exposed.
- when suspicious employee behavior is noticed (e.g. logins from uncommon geographic locations, or large downloads of information during non business hours), query Recorded Future identity intelligence (via "Credential Lookup" Action) to check if that user has had credentials exposed in prior dumps or malware logs.

Possible remediation include password resets, user privilege revocation, and user quarantining.  Advanced teams may also choose to flag users suspected of takeover by a threat actor to track usage through their system.

 
2. **Customer ("External" use case)**

Organizations that provide their customers with online services via a web-based login can use the Identity Intelligence module to assess whether their customers are at risk of fraudulent use by a third party.  Suggested work flows include:
- on a periodic basis, query Recorded Future identity intelligence (via "Credential Search" Action) for any compromised credentials that may have been exposed. 
- during account creation, use the Identity Intelligence module (via "Credential Lookup" Action) to check whether the username and/or username/password pair are previously compromised.
- during account login, check the Identity Intelligence module (via "Credential Lookup" Action) for whether the username/password pair is compromised.

Possible remediation include requiring a password reset, or temporarily locking down the account and requesting the user contact customer service for a user re-authentication process.

## Overview

This Solution consists of 6 Playbooks (Logic Apps).

"Connector" playbooks:
Custom connector are used to communicate and authorize towards Recorded Future backend API. 

| Playbook Name| Description  |
|-|-|
| **RFI-CustomConnector** | RFI-CustomConnector connection and autorization to Recorded Future Backend API.|

"Base" playbooks:
Sub playbooks that are called by the search playbooks. 

| Playbook Name | Description |
|-|-|
| **RFI-add-EntraID-security-group-user** | Add risky user to Microsoft EntraID Group for users at risk. |
| **RFI-confirm-EntraID-risky-user** | Confirm to Microsoft EntraID Identity Protection that user is compromised. |
| **RFI-lookup-and-save-user** | Lookup additional information on a compromised user and save results to Log Analytics. |

"Search" playbooks:
These are the main playbooks, select one and run on a schedule.  

| Playbook Name | Description |
|-|-|
| **RFI-search-workforce-user** | Search new exposures for Workforce users. |
| **RFI-search-external-user** | Search new exposures for External users. |

<br/>

## Deployment

We recommend deploying logic apps from this README, first the connector and then the base playbooks. Select one of the search playbooks dependent on your use case workforce or external.  

### Prerequisites

- A Microsoft EntraID Tenant and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Azure subscription Owner or Contributor permissions so you can install the Logic Apps. [Azure roles - Classic subscription administrator roles, Azure roles, and Entra ID roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles#azure-roles).
- A [Log Analytics workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs#send-to-log-analytics-workspace). If you don't have a workspace, learn [how to create a Log Analytics workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace). Note that the custom logs specified as parameters in these playbooks will be created automatically if they donâ€™t already exist.
- In Consumption logic apps, before you can create or manage logic apps and their connections, you need specific permissions. For more information about these permissions, review [Secure operations - Secure access and data in Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-securing-a-logic-app#secure-operations).
- For `Recorded Future Identity` Connections you will need `Recorded Future Identity API` token. To obtain one - check out [this section](#how_to_obtain_Recorded_Future_API_token).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deploy "Base" and "Connector"  playbooks before deploying the "Search" playbooks. 
> Make sure to use `lookup_lookback_days` same or larger than `search_lookback_days`. Otherwise you can encounter a situation when you get empty results on Lookup for the compromised credentials from the search.

<hr/>

<a id="base_playbooks"></a>
## "Base" playbooks

The "Base" playbooks is called from the search playbooks and used to take action to leaked credentials or mitigate the risks. 

<a id="add_risky_user_to_entraid_security_group"></a>
## RFI-add-EntraID-security-group-user

This playbook adds a compromised user to an Microsoft EntraID group. Triage and remediation should be handled in sub playbooks. 
By applying security policies to the Microsoft EntraID group and adding leaked users to that group - you can react to a leak and mitigate the risks.

**BEWARE: if you apply a Security Group policy that prohibits any compromised member from logging in, and you yourself get identified as having a compromised account, then you could potentially lock yourself out!**

### Workflow

| # | Action |
|-|-|
| 1 | From `user_principal_name` (email or email username + Entra ID domain if it is not empty). |
| 2 | Get user from EntraID by `user_principal_name`. |
| 3 | Add user to EntraID security group. |

### Parameters

**To configure playbooks - you need to create a Microsoft EntraID Group, and provide the group ID as a parameter to the Logic App. For more information, see [Microsoft EntraID Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups) documentation.**

HTTP request parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| **risky_user_email** | Compromised user email. |
| **active_directory_security_group_id** | ID of Microsoft EntraID Group for users at risk. You need to pre-create security group by hand: search for "Groups" in Service search at the top of the page. For more information, see [Microsoft EntraID Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups) documentation. |
| **active_directory_domain** | (Optional, can be left empty) - in case your Microsoft EntraID domain is different from your organization domain, this parameter will be used to transform compromised credentials to find corresponding user in your Microsoft EntraID Directory (ex. Compromised email: leaked@mycompany.com, your Microsoft EntraID domain: `@mycompany.onmicrosoft.com`, so you set parameter `active_directory_domain = mycompany.onmicrosoft.com` (**just domain, without "@"**), and search playbooks will replace the domain from the leaked email with the provided domain from the active_directory_domain parameter, before searching for the corresponding user in your Microsoft EntraID: `leaked@mycompany.com ->  leaked@mycompany.onmicrosoft.com`. (Lookup playbook - will still use the original email to Lookup the data). |

<a id="lookup_risky_user_and_save_results"></a>

## RFI-lookup-and-save-user

This playbook gets compromise identity details from Recorded Future Identity Intelligence and saves the data in Azure Log Analytics Workspace for further review and analysis.

Lookup returns more data than initial Search, so you will get the leaks' history for the email and other info.

### Workflow

| # | Action |
|-|-|
| 1 | Pull data from Recorded Future Identity API for specified email and time range. |
| 2 | Save Lookup results to Log Analytics Custom Log. |

### Parameters

HTTP request parameters:

| Parameter | Description  |
|-|-|
| **risky_user_email** | Compromised user email. |
| **lookup_lookback_days** | Time range for Lookup / number of days before today to search (e.g. input "-14" to search the last 14 days). **Make sure to use `lookup_lookback_days` same or larger than `search_lookback_days`. Otherwise you can encounter a situation when you get empty results on Lookup for the compromised credentials from the Search.** |
| **lookup_results_log_analytics_custom_log_name** | Name for Log Analytics Custom Log to save Lookup results at (**needs to end with "`_CL`"**) |

Logic App Parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| **lookup_lookback_days_default** | Default Lookup time range - used if corresponding HTTP request parameter is missing. **Make sure to use `lookup_lookback_days` same or larger than `search_lookback_days`. Otherwise you can encounter a situation when you get empty results on Lookup for the compromised credentials from the Search.** |
| **lookup_results_log_analytics_custom_log_name_default** | Default name for Log Analytics Custom Log to save Lookup results at (**needs to end with "`_CL`"**) - used if corresponding HTTP request parameter is missing. |

Parameters for deployment:

| Parameter | Description |
|-|-|
| **Subscription** | Your Azure Subscription to deploy the Solution in. All resources in an Azure subscription are billed together. |
| **Resource group** | Resource group in your Subscription to deploy the Solution in. A resource group is a collection of resources that share the same lifecycle, permissions, and policies. |
| **Region** | Choose the Azure region that's right for you and your customers. Not every resource is available in every region. |
| **Playbook-Name**  | Playbook name to use for this playbook (ex. "RFI-lookup-and-save-user"). |

### Troubleshooting:

If you use this playbook to Lookup leaks info for an email and response lookup data is empty (for specified email and lookback range) - the playbook will still save empty results to the Log Analytics Custom Log. 

This case is possible if you set up the Logic Apps in that way that Lookup lookback range (in `RFI-lookup-and-save-user` playbook) is smaller than Search lookback range (in `RFI-search-workforce-user` and `RFI-search-external-user` playbooks).

In that case you will see some empty records in the corresponding Log Analytics Custom Log (see the screenshot). 

<img src="./images/empty_lookup_results.png" alt="Empty Lookup results" width="60%"/>


To mitigate this case: make sure you set up the Lookup lookback range equal to or larger than the Search lookback range.

Another way to cover this case - you can add a corresponding check to RFI-lookup-and-save-user playbook and not save the results to Log Analytics if the result is empty.

<a id="search_playbooks"></a>

## "Search" playbooks (Workforce and External)

### Workflow of Search Logic Apps (both Workforce and External use cases)

Those playbooks search the Recorded Future Identity Intelligence Module for compromised workforce or external (customer) users.

| # | Action |
|-|-|
| 1 | Pull data from Recorded Future Identity API for specified domain and time range (can be "workforce" or "external" use case). |
| 2 | Pull previously seen/saved leaks data from Log Analytics Custom Log. |
| 3 | Compare data from step 1 and step 2 - to determine which leaks are new and haven't been seen previously by the Search Logic App. |
| 4 | Save the new leaks from step 3, so on the next run of the Search Logic App we would get that data on step 2. |
| 5 | Use "Base" Logic Apps to react / take actions on the newly leaked credentials. |

If you are using External use case - you will get info on your clients leaks, so probably the most valuable "Base" Logic App for you will be "Lookup risky user and save results", as "Add risky user to Microsoft EntraID Group" and "Microsoft EntraID Identity Protection - confirm user is compromised" assumes that the leaked email is a user in your organization Microsoft Entra ID, which is mostly probably not true for External use case.

### Parameters

Logic App Parameters for Search Logic App Workforce use case. These are configured in the Azure portal int the Logic App designer after installation.

| Parameter | Description | 
|-|-|
| **organization_domain** | Organization domain to search exposures for. |
| **search_lookback_days** | Time range for Search / number of days before today to search (e.g. input "-14" to search the last 14 days). |
| **malware_logs_log_analytics_custom_log_name** | Name for Log Analytics Custom Log to save Credential Dumps Search results at (**needs to end with "`_CL`"**). |
| **credential_dumps_log_analytics_custom_log_name** | Name for Log Analytics Custom Log to save Malware Logs Search results at (**needs to end with "`_CL`"**).  |
| **active_directory_security_group_id** | ID of Microsoft EntraID Group for users at risk. You need to pre-create it by hand: search for "Groups" in Service search at the top of the page. For more information, see [Microsoft EntraID Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups) documentation. |
| **lookup_lookback_days**  | Time range for Lookup / number of days before today to search (e.g. input "-14" to search the last 14 days). **Make sure to use `lookup_lookback_days` same or larger than `search_lookback_days`. Otherwise you can encounter a situation when you get empty results on Lookup for the compromised credentials from the Search.** |
| **lookup_results_log_analytics_custom_log_name**   | Name for Log Analytics Custom Log to save Lookup results at (**needs to end with "`_CL`"**). |
| **active_directory_domain** | (Optional, can be left empty) - in case your Microsoft EntraID domain is different from your organization domain, this parameter will be used to transform compromised credentials to find corresponding user in your Microsoft EntraID (ex. Compromised email: leaked@mycompany.com, your Microsoft EntraID domain: `@mycompany.onmicrosoft.com`, so you set parameter `active_directory_domain = mycompany.onmicrosoft.com` (**just domain, without "@"**), and search playbooks will replace the domain from the leaked email with the provided domain from the active_directory_domain parameter, before searching for the corresponding user in your Microsoft EntraID: `leaked@mycompany.com ->  leaked@mycompany.onmicrosoft.com`. (Lookup playbook - will still use the original email to Lookup the data). |

Logic App Parameters for Search Logic App "External use case" are the same as for "Workforce use case", except "External use case" does NOT need credential_dumps_log_analytics_custom_log_name parameter.

## How to configure playbooks

Every playbook (Logic App) can be configured using parameters in the playbook (Logic App). 

After deployment - initial set up for each deployed Logic App (playbook) includes:
- configuring [Connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/connectors/apis-list#connection-configuration)
- configuring [Parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/create-parameters-workflows?tabs=consumption#define-use-and-edit-parameters)


**What exact parameters to configure for a specific Playbook and what each of the parameters means - you can find in the corresponding [section of this document](#playbooks).** 

### How to find the playbooks (Logic Apps) after deployment

To find installed Playbooks (Logic Apps) after deployment - you can search for `Logic Apps` from the Azure Portal page and find deployed Logic Apps there.

<a id="configuration_connections"></a>
### Configuring Logic App Connections

After deployment - you will need to create/validate the Connections in each of deployed Logic Apps.

For `Recorded Future Identity` Connections you will need `Recorded Future Identity API` token. To obtain one - check out [this section](#how_to_obtain_Recorded_Future_API_token).

- You can add more advanced control of compromised Microsoft EntraID users using GraphQL API, which allows you to force a user to reset a password, etc. But it requires some additional Azure skills (secrets handling, etc).
- As Search and Lookup data is stored in Log Analytics Custom Log - you can create / set up custom Sentinel Alerts on that data.
- In current implementation Search request gets only 500 records per request. You can request more records using the "Results" parameter. Also you can create a loop and use the "Offset" parameter in Search to request all the records using pagination. Probably better to process/react on compromised credentials "on the go" in the same loop cycle you retrieved them.
