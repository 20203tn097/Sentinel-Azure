# Cohesity Restore From Last Snapshot Playbook
## Summary
This playbook restores the latest good Helios snapshot. Itâ€™s recommended for running by Backup Admins _only_ after they make sure that the existing data is compromised and rollback to the previous snapshot, even at the expense of data loss, is _really required_.

## Prerequisites
1. Create Helios API Key:
* Go to the Cohesity Helios [login](https://helios.cohesity.com/#/login) page.
* Enter your credentials and select _Log In_. The _Summary_ page is displayed.
* Navigate to _Settings > Access Management_. The _Users_ tab is displayed.
* Select _Add API Key_. The API Key Details is displayed.
* Enter a name for the API key.
* Select _Save_.

## Deployment instructions
1. Deploy the playbook by clicking on "Deploy to Azure" button. This will take you to deploying an ARM Template wizard.
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcohesity%2FAzure-Sentinel%2FCohesitySecurity.internal%2FSolutions%2FCohesitySecurity%2FPlaybooks%2FIncident_VM_Playbook%2Fazuredeploy.json)
2. Fill in the required parameters:
* __Playbook Name:__ Enter the playbook name here.
* __Job Id:__ Enter any random number.

## Post-Deployment instructions
1. Update API Key in the playbook
* In your Microsoft Sentinel Instance, go to the _Automation_ under the _Configuration_ pane.
* Under _Active Playbooks_, select the playbook and click on _Edit_.
* Select the _HTTP connector_.
* Under the _Headers_ section, enter the API key generated on Helios platform.
* Select _Save_.
2. (_Recommendation_) Limit access rights to this playbook to only Backup Admins because this playbook rolls back customer data that can result in a loss of important data if used without a good reason.
* From the Microsoft Sentinel navigation menu, select _Settings_.
* In the _Settings_ blade, select the _Settings_ tab and expand _Playbook Permissions_.
* Select _Configure Permissions_ to open the _Manage Permissions_ panel.
* Select the required resource group and click _Apply_.
* Select _Done_.
