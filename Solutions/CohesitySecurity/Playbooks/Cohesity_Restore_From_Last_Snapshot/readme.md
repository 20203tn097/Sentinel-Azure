# Cohesity Restore From Last Snapshot Playbook
## Summary
This playbook restores the latest good Helios snapshot. Itâ€™s recommended for running by Backup Admins _only_ after they make sure that the existing data is compromised, and rollback to the previous snapshot, even at the expense of data loss, is _really required_.

## Prerequisites
1. Install [this](https://github.com/cohesity/Azure-Sentinel/blob/CohesitySecurity.internal/Solutions/CohesitySecurity/Data%20Connectors/Helios2Sentinel/readme.md) Azure function configuration.
**Note:** If you already did it for another playbook (see [example](https://github.com/cohesity/Azure-Sentinel/blob/CohesitySecurity.internal/Solutions/CohesitySecurity/Playbooks/Cohesity_Close_Helios_Incident/readme.md)), then proceed to the deployment steps.

## Deployment instructions
1. Deploy the playbook by clicking on the "Deploy to Azure" button. This will take you to deploying an ARM Template wizard.
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcohesity%2FAzure-Sentinel%2FCohesitySecurity.internal%2FSolutions%2FCohesitySecurity%2FPlaybooks%2FCohesity_Restore_From_Last_Snapshot%2Fazuredeploy.json)
2. Fill in the required parameters:
* __Playbook Name:__ Enter the playbook name here.

## Post-Deployment instructions
1. Authorize all connections
* Go to _Logic Apps_ and choose your playbook
* In the _Developmnet Tools_ sections select _API Connections_. In the left pane you'll see the list of connections that you'll need to authorize
  * Authorize the storage connection by selecting it and clicking on _General\Edit API Connection_
    * Enter your connection name, storage account and access key. You can find them by selecting your storage account [here](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts) and then choosing _Security+networking\Access keys_).
2. (_Recommendation_) Limit access rights to this playbook to only Backup Admins because this playbook rolls back customer data that can result in a loss of important data if used without a good reason.
* From the Microsoft Sentinel navigation menu, select _Settings_.
* In the _Settings_ blade, select the _Settings_ tab and expand _Playbook Permissions_.
* Select _Configure Permissions_ to open the _Manage Permissions_ panel.
* Select the required resource group and click _Apply_.
* Select _Done_.

## Troubleshooting
1. If you'd like to use this playbook without installing the [Azure functions configuration](https://github.com/cohesity/Azure-Sentinel/blob/CohesitySecurity.internal/Solutions/CohesitySecurity/Data%20Connectors/Helios2Sentinel/readme.md), then you need to do a few manual steps _before_ deployment.
* Create the _DataHawk API_ key:
  * Go to the Cohesity Helios [login](https://helios.cohesity.com/#/login) page.
  * Enter your credentials and select _Log In_. The _Summary_ page is displayed.
  * Navigate to _Settings > Access Management_. The _Users_ tab is displayed.
  * Select _Add API Key_. The API Key Details is displayed.
  * Enter a name for the API key.
  * Select _Save_.
* Create your Azure KeyVault (see [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal)).
  * Create the _ApiKey_ secret and assign the _API Key_ value from the previous step to it. Now your API key is securely saved in the Azure KeyVault.
* Create your Azure Blob Storage container (see [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container)) with the name _cohesity-extra-parameters_.
2. If you see the _Forbidden_ error message in the Keyvault block when you run the playbook, you can always authorize it manualy
* Choose your app in the [Logic Apps](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Logic%2Fworkflows)
* Authorize your KeyVault connection by selecting it and clicking on _General\Edit API Connection_
* Press the _Authorize_ button and select the appropriate account. Enter your key vault name if prompted. You can find your key vault name [here](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.KeyVault%2Fvaults).
* **Note**: If you can't authorize the connections using the steps above, you can always open your playbook in _Development Tools\Logic App Designer_, click on the connection block, and then click on the _Change connection_ link in the right pane. Then you can either create a new connection, choose a different one or authorize the one that is marked with an "i" sign.
