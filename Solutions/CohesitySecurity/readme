Follow this doc to Setup build prerequisite
    Tools/Create-Azure-Sentinel-Solution/V2/README.md:7 ## Setup

For now, 99% of the compile works in macos, and suppose to be run under repository root folder.

1: steps to create/update Data Connectors:
    Just directly use this one:
        Solutions/CohesitySecurity/Data\ Connectors/helios_connector.json
    If you need to update the Data Connectors for Sentinel, please update this file first, and then check in to Git.
    check this line to decide which api key to use:
        Solutions/CohesitySecurity/Data\ Connectors/helios_connector.json:100                     "apiEndpoint": "https://helios.cohesity.com/mcm/alerts?maxAlerts=10&alertCategoryList=kSecurity&alertStateList=kOpen",

2: steps to create/update Analytic Rules:
    export the Analytic Rules from Sentinel one by one, and its output format is json
    For package build, they have to be in yaml format.
    use this tool to convert RansomwareAlert.json to yaml format
        https://github.com/h0ffayyy/sentinel-to-yaml
    It works.

    But several issues:
        Due to cohesity firewall policy, the pip/pip3 install would fail, have to add --trusted-host to bypass.
        For the same reason, the az cli to add sentinel module don't work, don't have too much time to find a solution for this.
        could not overwrite existing file.
    So, it is difficult to 100% automation for Analytic Rules now due to the firewall policy.

3: steps to create/update Playbook:
    run this command in windows to export the Playbooks:
        Tools/Playbook-ARM-Template-Generator/src/Playbook_ARM_Template_Generator.ps1
    This line of code could only run in windows
        Tools/Playbook-ARM-Template-Generator/src/Playbook_ARM_Template_Generator.ps1:541     $GetSubscriptions = Get-AzSubscription -TenantId $TenantID | Where-Object {($_.state -eq 'enabled') } | Out-GridView -Title "Select Subscription to Use" -PassThru
        Need to find Alternative to Out-GridView, so as to run in mac.
    This tool will export/save the Selected Playbooks into your local json files, with name azuredeploy.json.
    you need to rename the default name "azuredeploy.json" to any other meaningful name, to avoid a later validation error.
    then run this command to overwrite the existing one like:
        mv -fv ~/Downloads/Incident_Email_Playbook/azuredeploy.json ~/workspace/Azure-Sentinel/Solution/CohesitySecurity/Playbooks/Incident_Email_Playbook/Incident_Email_Playbook.json

    For the exported json Playbooks, needs to manually update the apiVersion to be recent:
        "apiVersion": "2017-07-01" --> "apiVersion": "2019-05-01",

    There is a interminent validation issue:
        Variables Must Be Referenced
            [-] Variables Must Be Referenced (63 ms)
                Unreferenced variable: playbook4-Service-NowConnectionName
                Unreferenced variable: playbook7-Service-NowConnectionName
    but could not find any occurence after building, and the deployment pass, so, let's just ignore this issue for now.

4: Build the Solution under repository root folder:
    ➜  Azure-Sentinel git:(CohesitySecurity.fix) ✗ pwsh /Users/ying.huang/workspace/Azure-Sentinel/Tools/Create-Azure-Sentinel-Solution/createSolution.ps1

5: Follow this doc to do the post-build manually validation
