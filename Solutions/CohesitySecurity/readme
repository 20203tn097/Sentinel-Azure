Follow this doc to Setup build prerequisite
    Tools/Create-Azure-Sentinel-Solution/V2/README.md:7 ## Setup

For now, 99% of the compile works in macos, and suppose to be run under repository root folder.

1: steps to create/update Data Connectors:
    Just directly use this one:
        Solutions/CohesitySecurity/Data\ Connectors/helios_connector.json
    If you need to update the Data Connectors for Sentinel, please update this file first, and then check in to Git.
    check this line to decide which api key to use:
        Solutions/CohesitySecurity/Data\ Connectors/helios_connector.json:100                     "apiEndpoint": "https://helios.cohesity.com/mcm/alerts?maxAlerts=10&alertCategoryList=kSecurity&alertStateList=kOpen",
    in this case, we should use apiKey: 33e44eac-ce99-46df-7f4e-9ac39446a66e

2: steps to create/update Analytic Rules:
    export the Analytic Rules from Sentinel one by one, and its output format is json
    For package build, they have to be in yaml format.
    use this command to convert RansomwareAlert.json to yaml format
        ➜  Azure-Sentinel git:(CohesitySecurity.fix) ✗ yq -P ./Solutions/CohesitySecurity/Analytic\ Rules/RansomwareAlert.json > ./Solutions/CohesitySecurity/Analytic\ Rules/RansomwareAlert.yaml

    Manually update the RansomwareAlert.yaml file:
        move these attributes to be top, no indent.
            description
            name
            queryFrequency
            queryPeriod
            triggerOperator
            triggerThreshold
        Further change these attributes's values:
            queryFrequency: PT5M --> queryFrequency: 5m
            queryPeriod: PT5M --> queryPeriod: 5m
            triggerOperator: GreaterThan --> triggerOperator: gt

3: steps to create/update Playbook:
    run this command in windows to export the Playbooks:
        Tools/Playbook-ARM-Template-Generator/src/Playbook_ARM_Template_Generator.ps1
    This line of code could only run in windows
        Tools/Playbook-ARM-Template-Generator/src/Playbook_ARM_Template_Generator.ps1:541     $GetSubscriptions = Get-AzSubscription -TenantId $TenantID | Where-Object {($_.state -eq 'enabled') } | Out-GridView -Title "Select Subscription to Use" -PassThru
        Need to find Alternative to Out-GridView, so as to run in mac.

4: Build the Solution under repository root folder:
    ➜  Azure-Sentinel git:(CohesitySecurity.fix) ✗ pwsh /Users/ying.huang/workspace/Azure-Sentinel/Tools/Create-Azure-Sentinel-Solution/createSolution.ps1

5: Follow this doc to do the post-build manually validation
